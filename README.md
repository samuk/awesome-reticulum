## Network Stack

* [markqvist / Reticulum](https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum) - The cryptography-based networking stack for building unstoppable networks with LoRa, Packet Radio, WiFi and everything in between.
* [markqvist / LXMF](https://github.com/markqvist/LXMF) - A simple and flexible messaging format and delivery protocol that allows a wide variety of implementations, while using as little bandwidth as possible.
* [ion232 / reticulum-zig](https://github.com/ion232/reticulum-zig) - An implementation of Reticulum in Zig targeting operating systems and embedded devices.

## Node Firmware

* [DanBeard / RETCON](https://github.com/DanBeard/RETCON) - RETCON enables quick creation of pre-configured Raspberry Pi images that automatically form resilient mesh networks once deployed.
* [AkitaEngineering / ESP32-C3-Reticulum-Node](https://github.com/AkitaEngineering/ESP32-C3-Reticulum-Node) - This project provides firmware to turn an ESP32-C3 (or compatible ESP32 variant) into a multi-interface Reticulum Network Stack gateway node.It allows devices communicating via different physical layers (WiFi UDP, ESP-NOW, Serial, Bluetooth) to exchange Reticulum packets seamlessly.

## Messangers and Browsers

* [markqvist / NomadNet](https://github.com/markqvist/NomadNet) - Off-grid, resilient mesh communication with strong encryption, forward secrecy and extreme privacy.
* [markqvist / Sideband](https://github.com/markqvist/Sideband) - Sideband is an extensible LXMF messaging and LXST telephony client, situational awareness tracker and remote control and monitoring system for Android, Linux, macOS and Windows.
* [liamcottle / reticulum-meshchat](https://github.com/liamcottle/reticulum-meshchat) - A simple mesh network communications app powered by the Reticulum Network Stack.
* [torlando-tech / columba](https://github.com/torlando-tech/columba) - A simple messaging app for the Reticulum network on Android using Bluetooth LE over Reticulum.

## Utilities

* [SebastianObi / LXMF-Tools](https://github.com/SebastianObi/LXMF-Tools) - Various small programs and tools which use the message protocol LXMF.

## Flasher

* [liamcottle / rnode-flasher](https://github.com/liamcottle/rnode-flasher) - A web based firmware flasher for Reticulum / RNode_Firmware.

## Transports

* [LFManifesto / ReticulumHF](https://github.com/LFManifesto/ReticulumHF) - Encrypted communication over HF radio using the Reticulum Network Stack and FreeDV digital modes.
