## Network Stack

* [markqvist / Reticulum](https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum) - The cryptography-based networking stack for building unstoppable networks with LoRa, Packet Radio, WiFi and everything in between.
* [markqvist / LXMF](https://github.com/markqvist/LXMF) - A simple and flexible messaging format and delivery protocol that allows a wide variety of implementations, while using as little bandwidth as possible.
* [ion232 / reticulum-zig](https://github.com/ion232/reticulum-zig) - An implementation of Reticulum in Zig targeting operating systems and embedded devices.

## Node Firmware

* [markqvist / RNode_Firmware](https://github.com/markqvist/RNode_Firmware) - An RNode is an open, free and unrestricted digital radio transceiver. It enables anyone to send and receive any kind of data over both short and very long distances. RNodes can be used with many different kinds of programs and systems, but they are especially well suited for use with Reticulum.
* [DanBeard / RETCON](https://github.com/DanBeard/RETCON) - RETCON enables quick creation of pre-configured Raspberry Pi images that automatically form resilient mesh networks once deployed.
* [AkitaEngineering / ESP32-C3-Reticulum-Node](https://github.com/AkitaEngineering/ESP32-C3-Reticulum-Node) - This project provides firmware to turn an ESP32-C3 (or compatible ESP32 variant) into a multi-interface Reticulum Network Stack gateway node.It allows devices communicating via different physical layers (WiFi UDP, ESP-NOW, Serial, Bluetooth) to exchange Reticulum packets seamlessly.
* [strijar / RNS-Gate](https://github.com/strijar/RNS-Gate) - Standalone device for access and routing within the Reticulum Network Stack
* [gretel / reticulum-openwrt](https://github.com/gretel/reticulum-openwrt) - GitHub workflow for cross-compiling Reticulum Network Stack (RNS) packages for OpenWrt.

## Messangers and Browsers

* [markqvist / NomadNet](https://github.com/markqvist/NomadNet) - Off-grid, resilient mesh communication with strong encryption, forward secrecy and extreme privacy.
* [markqvist / Sideband](https://github.com/markqvist/Sideband) - Sideband is an extensible LXMF messaging and LXST telephony client, situational awareness tracker and remote control and monitoring system for Android, Linux, macOS and Windows.
* [liamcottle / reticulum-meshchat](https://github.com/liamcottle/reticulum-meshchat) - A simple mesh network communications app powered by the Reticulum Network Stack.
* [torlando-tech / columba](https://github.com/torlando-tech/columba) - A simple messaging app for the Reticulum network on Android using Bluetooth LE over Reticulum.
* [Ren / Browser](https://git.quad4.io/Ren/Browser) - A browser for the Reticulum Network.Target platforms: Web, Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS. Built using Flet.
* [kc1awv/ lxst_phone](https://github.com/kc1awv/lxst_phone) - A peer-to-peer voice calling application built on the Reticulum Network Stack.

## Transport and Network Interfaces

* [LFManifesto / ReticulumHF](https://github.com/LFManifesto/ReticulumHF) - Encrypted communication over HF radio using the Reticulum Network Stack and FreeDV digital modes.
* [torlando-tech /  ble-reticulum](https://github.com/torlando-tech/ble-reticulum) - A Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) interface for Reticulum Network Stack, enabling mesh networking over BLE without additional hardware on Linux devices.
* [Reticulum-Interfaces/ RNS-over-HTTP](https://git.quad4.io/Reticulum-Interfaces/RNS-over-HTTP) - A Reticulum interface that tunnels traffic over standard HTTP/S POST requests. This allows Reticulum to operate on networks where only web traffic is permitted, effectively bypassing firewalls, DPI, and other restrictions.
* [AkitaEngineering / Akita-Dynamic-DDNS-for-Reticulum](https://github.com/AkitaEngineering/Akita-Dynamic-DDNS-for-Reticulum) - Akita DDNS is a robust, decentralized, and dynamic destination naming system (DDNS) built specifically for the Reticulum Network Stack.

## LXMF Bots

* [randogoth / lxmf-bot](https://codeberg.org/randogoth/lxmf-bot.git) - Python class to easily develop a simple Telethon style chatbot for the LXMF protocol.
* [lxmfy / LXMFy](https://github.com/lxmfy/LXMFy) - Easily create LXMF bots for the Reticulum Network with this extensible framework.
* [lxmfy / ollama-bot](https://github.com/lxmfy/ollama-bot) - Interact with Ollama LLMs using LXMFy bot framework.

## Content Server

* [RNS-Things / rns-page-node](https://git.quad4.io/RNS-Things/rns-page-node) - A simple way to serve pages and files over the Reticulum network. Drop-in replacement for NomadNet nodes that primarily serve pages and files.
